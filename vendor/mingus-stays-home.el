;; Copyright (C) 2006-2008 Niels Giesen <com dot gmail at nielsgiesen, in
;; reversed order>

;; Author: Niels Giesen <pft on #emacs>

;; Version: Minor Intrusions, or: 0.26
;; Latest version can be found at http://niels.kicks-ass.org/emacs/mingus

;; For Changes, please view http://niels.kicks-ass.org/public/mingus/src/ChangeLog

;; NEW in 0.23:

;; Removed silly dependencies for calculating time of song (mpd already knows
;; about them: RTFM afore thou proggest pft!).

;; Substituted sentinels for timers.

;; NEW in 0.22:

;; Added ogg and flac support for metadata (the mingus-id3-* functions)

;; Added flac and wav support for `mingus-burn-it'

;; Fixed a shitload of bugs; introduced just as many (hopefully not).

;; Increased number of dependencies to do all this (see below under 'Further
;; requirements').

;; NOTE (at version 0.21) : Version 0.21 is actually the first published version
;; of mingus-stays-home. To provide easy checking whether the versions of
;; mingus.el and mingus-stays-home (should) work together, it was decided to
;; give them concurrent version numbers.

;; Keywords: multimedia, elisp, music, mpd

;;; COMMENTARY:

;; INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

;; Byte-compile, IN ORDER, repeat: IN ORDER, the files mingus.el and
;; mingus-stays-home.el

;; Then put the following in your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/where/mingus-and-mingus-stays-home-reside")
;; (autoload 'mingus "mingus-stays-home")

;; Make sure you have a version of mingus.el of the same version number
;; available in your load-path.

;; FUNCTIONALITY

;;; Goal: provide extra functionality to mingus that is only possible when mpd
;;; is run locally, i.e. the frontend has full access to the configuration file
;;; and the filesystem used by mpd.

;;; Extent: currently undecided, but at least:

;;; * integration with other emacs-modes:

;;; ** DIRED:

;;; Ability to snap to the file location of a song instantly in `dired', so as
;;; to perform file management or other actions on these files easily (such as
;;; removal, movement or renaming), or just to check wtfs '3.ogg' actually
;;; refers to.

;;; You might want to change the `dired-mode-map' so that it will play well with
;;; Mingus.  If you want to, you can set the variable `mingus-dired-add-keys' to
;;; t; this can be done with `mingus-customize'. It will set "SPC" to
;;; `mingus-dired-add', "C-u SPC" to `mingus-dired-add-and-play' and add an item
;;; for `mingus-dired-add' to the menu-bar in dired. `mingus-dwim-add' and
;;; `mingus-dwim-add-and-play' (see below) calls mingus-dired-add when in dired,
;;; so binding this to a global key might be a nice solution too.

;;; ** MINIBUFFER COMPLETION:

;;; using the minibuffer in a better way to add songs or directories, than
;;; mingus-insert previously did. This is done with the function
;;; `mingus-dwim-add'. `mingus-insert' keeps its old behaviour.

;;; ** ID3-TAGGING:

;;; see `mingus-id3-set' and `mingus-id3-erase' (only to be called from within
;;; `mingus')

;;; ** BURNING CD'S with `mingus-burns'! In DEVELOPMENT stage, but nonetheless
;;; ** usable.

;;; Make sure the directory referred to by the variable
;;; `mingus-burns-tmp-wav-dir' (default: "~/.mingus/tmp") exists. This is where
;;; the intermediate files in the burning process will go.

;;; NOTE mingus-burns currently does NOT check for the capacity of the inserted
;;; disk, nor whether it is writable. You are left to your own devices for
;;; this. The green-redness if the indication bar displays just what is usually
;;; encountered.

;;; INFO: mingus-burns records cd's with the contents of the current playlist of
;;; mpd. It can also just be used to see what the duration of a playlist and its
;;; respective songs (ONLY if in ogg- or mp3 format) is. Currently the
;;; playlist-editing functions are *not* as wide as in the normal playlist
;;; buffer (tagged `*Mingus*'). However, basic support for deletion of song at
;;; point and of songs in region does exist, with respect for the variables
;;; `*mingus-point-of-insertion*' and `*mingus-marked-list*'. You can add songs
;;; without leaving the *Mingus Burns* buffer as well, by use of
;;; mingus-dwim-add. Adding songs leads to a complete recomputation of song
;;; duration, which may take a while, so the fastest way to achieve nice
;;; contents for your CD is to first add a bunch of songs (but not way to much
;;; of course), and then delete the ones you can do without. It looks more
;;; attractive than the default playlist buffer, but because of the slowness
;;; inherent in computing duration, it is not planned to be a full substitute
;;; for it, at least not in the near future.

;;; REQUIREMENTS:

;;; version 0.22 required too much, glad to be able to trim it down again in
;;; version 0.23 after having read some documentation:

;;; TAGGING

;;; metaflac -- for flac files

;;; id3v2 -- for mp3s

;;; vorbiscomment -- for oggs

;;; (does anyone know of a good NONinteractive multitagger?)

;;; decoding:

;;; sox -- for decoding songs to the .wav format.

;;; flac -- for decoding flacs to the .wav format. Must get flac into sox...

;;; burning:

;;; cdrecord (or: wodim, if you stick to Debian guidelines) -- for burning the
;;; cd. Actually, this can be customized with the variables
;;; `mingus-blank-string' and `mingus-burns-format-string'


;;; ** VIEW COVER ART (ach, why not?)

;;; when available, you can use `thumbs' to view cover art from within Mingus:
;;; see `mingus-thumbs' (key: "T")

;;; known bugs: sometimes unicode strings in tags can lead to errors.

;;; For any questions, suggestions and so forth, contact nielsgiesen at ibbu dot
;;; nl

;;; ( use dto's --already deprecated-- golisp-mode to make use of the indexing
;;; in this file: find it at http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/GoLisp.html )

;;; Code:
(require 'mingus)
